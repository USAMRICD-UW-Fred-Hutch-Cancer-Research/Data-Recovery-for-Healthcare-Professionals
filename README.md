🏥 Overview
-----------

**Data Recovery for Healthcare Professionals** is a specialized laboratory at Seattle Data Recovery dedicated to the unique needs of the medical community. We understand that in healthcare, data is more than just information---it is patient history, diagnostic accuracy, and operational continuity.

We operate out of the **University of Washington Medical Building** in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, providing local, high-security data restoration for hospitals, private practices, and medical research institutions.

⚡ Core Competencies
-------------------

### 1\. Legacy Restoration (1950s -- Present)

We are one of the few labs in the world with the engineering capability to restore data across the entire history of computing:

-   **The Dawn of Storage:** Recovery from 1950s-era magnetic drum and early platter-based systems (e.g., IBM RAMAC heritage).

-   **Vintage Enterprise:** Restoration of legacy mainframe drives, early SCSI arrays, and proprietary medical hardware.

-   **Modern Media:** Forensic recovery from NVMe SSDs, high-velocity CFexpress cards, and enterprise-grade RAID servers.

### 2\. Medical Systems Recovery

Our lab specializes in the architecture of medical data:

-   **Medical Servers:** Recovery of failed SQL/Oracle databases supporting Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and EHR systems.

-   **Diagnostic Imaging (PACS):** Reconstruction of corrupted DICOM files and high-resolution imaging archives.

-   **Endpoint Medical Computers:** Restoration of critical data from nursing station terminals and surgical imaging workstations.

🔒 Security & Compliance
------------------------

Data integrity in the medical field is a legal and ethical mandate. We provide a **Championship-Tier Defense** for Protected Health Information (PHI):

-   **HIPAA Compliance:** All recovery protocols strictly adhere to federal privacy and security standards.

-   **Local Data Sovereignty:** We do not outsource. Every drive is recovered in our secure Ballard lab to ensure a strict chain of custody.

-   **Air-Gapped Recovery:** Critical medical data is processed on isolated hardware stacks to prevent external breaches during the reconstruction phase.

* * * * *

🚀 The "Super Processing" Edge
------------------------------

We utilize proprietary **Super Processing** technology to render recovered data with greater precision than standard recovery services:

-   **128-Bit Precision:** Our hardware stack utilizes 128-bit math to eliminate the rounding errors that lead to "dull" or artifact-heavy data reconstruction.

-   **NVIDIA Accelerated:** Utilizing the latest NVIDIA architecture to accelerate the re-indexing of fragmented medical databases and high-density imaging.
